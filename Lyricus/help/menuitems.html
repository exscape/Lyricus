<h1>Lyricus menu items</h1>
<p>This help page discusses all the custom menu items in Lyricus (i.e. menu items such as Print or Find will not be mentioned in detail.</p>

<h2>Edit &gt; "Enter edit mode"</h2>
<p>
Enables edit mode, where you can edit the displayed lyrics. To save your changes, press &#x2318;S or "Save lyrics" (see below).<br />
If you want to discard your changes, leave edit move without saving and answer "Don't save" when asked.<br />
See <i><a href="editing.html">editing</a></i> for more information.
</p>

<h2>Edit &gt; "Save lyrics"</h2>
<p>
Saves the lyrics that are currently displayed to the track named in the window title.<br />
Note that Lyricus will save downloaded automatically; you only need to save if you've made changes in edit mode (see above).
</p>

<h2>Edit &gt; "Save displayed lyrics to current track"</h2>
<p>
Unlike the standard save function above, this saves the displayed lyrics to the track that is <strong>currently playing</strong>, ignoring mismatches.<br />
This can be useful, for instance, when searching for lyrics for cover songs:<br />
<ol>
    <li>Play a cover track in iTunes; let's say that no lyrics are found for the cover artist title</li>
    <li>Search manually for the original artist instead (using &#x2318;N or Lyric &gt; "Search for lyrics...")</li>
    <li>If found, save the lyrics to the still-playing cover track using Edit &gt; "Save displayed lyrics to current track".
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Lyric &gt; "Search for lyrics..."</h2>
<p>
Search for song lyrics manually, instead of getting the artist and song name from iTunes.<br />
Note that Lyricus will update the lyric display if iTunes is playing music and the currently playing song changes.
</p>

<h2>Lyric &gt; "Batch downloader..."</h2>
<p>
Opens the <i><a href="batch.html">batch downloader</a></i>, which downloads lyrics for entire playlists at once.
</p>

<h2>Lyric &gt; "Go to songmeanings page"</h2>
<p>
Opens the lyric and comment page (if any) on songmeanings.net.<br />
Songmeanings is a large lyric community which offers users a way to comment on song themes and meanings.
</p>

<h2>Lyric &gt; "Reverse lyric search..."</h2>
<p>
Opens the <i><a href="reverse.html">reverse lyric search</a></i> window, which allows you to find songs based on words or phrases in their lyrics.
</p>

<h2>Lyric &gt; "Update reverse lyric search index"</h2>
<p>
Updates the search index used for the reverse lyric search window.<br />
Unless you've set the preference not to ask, Lyricus will ask you to update the index whenever it is more than one week old.
